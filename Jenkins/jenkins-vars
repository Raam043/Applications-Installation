BRANCH_IS_PRIMARY
For a multibranch project, if the SCM source reports that the branch being built is a primary branch, this will be set to "true"; else unset. Some SCM sources may report more than one branch as a primary branch while others may not supply this information.
CHANGE_ID
For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the change ID, such as a pull request number, if supported; else unset.

BUILD_NUMBER
The current build number, such as "153".

JENKINS_URL
Full URL of Jenkins, like http://server:port/jenkins/ (note: only available if Jenkins URL set in system configuration).

JOB_URL
Full URL of this job, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/ (Jenkins URL must be set).
GIT_COMMIT

GIT_URL
The remote URL. If there are multiple, will be GIT_URL_1, GIT_URL_2, etc.
